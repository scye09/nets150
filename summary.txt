Recommendations and Document Search

Using the Facebook Messenger API, we created a Facebook chat bot that provides
movie recommendations to users. To determine important recommendations, we used
the vector space model and cosine similarity to compare the similarity of various
movies based on user input. The query that the user inputs can either be a movie
title or some key words that describe the movie. The bot returns the title of a
movie that is most similar to the movie that the user entered or contains the key
words in its description. The dataset that we used contained synopses of over
42000 movies: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/.

Our project is based off of the process described at this link:
